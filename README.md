This is the API for the school chat app I'm currently developing.
The data is stored in a MongoDB database, and I use the base "mongodb" driver with TypeScript.
I have made separate files for dealing with different collections, which are in the "db_handling" folder.

The actual app itself is like a crossover between MS Teams and Discord, including notices for the whole school/specific groups.
The project aims to make school life a bit less formal and make knowing what's going on around the school easier through a public noticeboard.
